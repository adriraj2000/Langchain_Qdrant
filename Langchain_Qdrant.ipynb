Conversely, a decrease in the money supply can lead to higher interest rates.\\n- Inflation rate: Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, so lenders demand higher interest rates to compensate for the expected loss in value over time.\\n- Policies of the central bank (such as the Reserve Bank of India) and government: These policies can influence interest rates through measures such as setting benchmark interest rates, implementing monetary policy, and regulating the financial sector.'"
